Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

Line 14: .ORIG is omitted before first line of instruction
Line 16: since .ORIG is omitted, this instruction appears before .ORIG
Line 17: x3010 excesses the maxmimum range of a 9-bit offset
Line 19: an extra comma between the first two oprands
Line 30: x300F excesses the maxmimum range of a 9-bit offset
Line 32: BRANCH instuction condition needs to be in nzp order
Line 35: xxxx is just a placeholder, hasn't been filled in with valid number
Line 43: after all instructions, .END is omitted



Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

OUTERLOOP:	x3005
INNERLOOP:	x3009
INPUT:		x3016
RESULT:		x3019



Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

Using labels makes much more sense, since programmer doesn't need to count memory offsets, and doesn't need to change the offset manually when modifying the program.
